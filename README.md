# Overview

This task will guide you through the process of homogenous migration of an
on-premise PostgreSQL database to PostgreSQL for RDS using available tools:
AWS EC2, AWS RDS, and AWS DMS.

## Prerequisites

To successfully complete this task, you will need:

- To fork this repository and clone it to your local machine to have access to
  lab resources at any time.
- An AWS account with an available free tier. If your free tier has already
  expired, the resources you create may incur some costs.
- Familiarity with the terminal. While database operations can be performed
  using specific DB tools like DBeaver, some tasks will require you to operate
  via the command line.

## Structure

This lab consists of several lessons, each separated by tasks, with each task in its
own directory. Each lesson includes a description and resources with additional
materials necessary for successful completion (if any).

## Lessons

This lab contains the following lessons:

1. Creation of the EC2 instance
2. Setting up the on-premise PostgreSQL database
3. Preparing the PostgreSQL database for RDS
4. Migrating the data from on-premise to RDS
5. Evaluating the consistency of the migrated data

Each lesson takes several hours to complete. While the tasks themselves are rather
straightforward, some elements may go wrong and will require intensive
troubleshooting.
